Thanks to Mr.Dooley's information, you come to the house's back door. As you step into the overgrown backyard, a chill prickles your skin. The air, thick with decay, is broken only by the rustle of unseen creatures. Weeds claw at your ankles as you navigate the neglected garden. Behind the house, dense shrubbery twists in agony. A half-fallen tree, its trunk split and rotting, resembles a festering wound. The sight fills you with dread.

You push aside the tangled branches to reach the back door. You try to open the back door, but it's locked.

3. Search for possible keys near the gate.

The sound sends a shiver down your spine, echoing ominously in the stillness. Heart pounding, you follow the noise. The staircase is old and decrepit, each step groaning under your weight. The darkness is thick, and every creak sounds unnaturally loud in the oppressive gloom.

As you ascend, the air grows colder, and the sensation of being watched intensifies. The faint moonlight casts ghostly patterns on the walls. At the top, a long, narrow hallway stretches before you. A door stands slightly ajar, its edges swallowed by shadow. As you approach, the door swings open slowly, revealing a dark, foreboding room beyond.

choices:
1. Get inside the room.
2. Check the ajarred door. 
3. Go to other rooms.
