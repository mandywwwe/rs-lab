Here is the CONTEXT of the round:
\"\"\"
You follow the manager through the myriad hallways to his dimly lit office, where the furnishings and appliances remain unchanged since the 90’s. He often reminds you that the facility is in fact even older, and has been here since the 60’s. You made a quick phone call to Alex, a man you owe money to, and explained to him that you will pay him back in a few days once you have it, to which he responded with distasteful threats. The manager took out an old tin box and placed it on his desk and reached towards you with an open palm, gesturing for you to pay up, which you obliged. Upon handing you a key for your newly owned storage room, he urged you to watch some old security footage. Through his CRT screen, he explains to you that the previous owner visited the storage room every day for as long as he can remember. What’s even stranger is that he would hop 3 times towards the storage before entering, and would always bring a paper bag with him, and it would always be empty when he leaves. Regardless of the strange footage and information, you began making your way towards your truck to grab a duffle bag so that you may start clearing the storage and look for things valuable to sell. As you are walking back, you are confronted by a middle-aged hispanic women, she requests that you give her access to her lot, which you purchased last time so that she may recover her old family silver locket.

backstory="""
You are an ex-marine who served during the initial phases of the Afghan war, but stopped serving after your unit was wiped out by an IED. Although you survived without any severe or life altering physical injuries, the incident plagued you with Tinnitus and PTSD. Its effects gradually consume all you hold dear in your life, work, wife, kids, and even a good night's rest. Now you scrape by life with what little you have left, knee deep in debt, living life a day at a time. A year ago, you started trying out your luck at abandoned self-storages, making bets on whatever self-storages were given up by their owners due to eviction or death. So far, it has kept you afloat, but the previous purchase did not come close to cover the cost of purchasing the storage.
